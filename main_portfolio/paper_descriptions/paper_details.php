<li>Understand and explain how IT is used in a home or small business environment.</li>
<li>Identify and describe the main components and peripherals of a computer system.</li>
<li>Identify threats to a computer system and how these can be mitigated.</li>
<li>Understand and describe health and ergonomic issues concerning IT.</li>
<li>Develop an understanding of the impact of IT on society, both historically, at present and in the future.</li></ol>","learning"=>"&nbsp;It was the first moment that I was involved in Information Technology world. As the course aims to introduce a wide range of IT, I could taste general subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;When I was learning basic of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Database and Operating Systems in the class, I didn’t know how they will be used in real world or even I didn’t know what they are. Now I am thinking that I was doing programming!!<br /><br /> 
&nbsp;I learned basic concepts and usages of IT skills such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript used for web service. The course also taught basic grammar of database query. In operating systems, I could understand the difference between MS Windows and Unix systems.
","difficulty"=>"&nbsp;Learning new subjects is always nervous and exiting. Learning new subjects in English caused a bit difficulty of understanding theory parts of IT. At the beginning of learning JavaScript, it was hard to understand the programming code. Such as increment in loop statements to move an object on web was challenging.
<br /><br />&nbsp;Looking back, I couldn’t imagine that I will be a programmer at that stage.

<li>Create and format documents for visual presentation.</li>
<li>Use current information technology tools to gather and disseminate information.</li>
<li>Use current commercial software to enter quantitative data, perform accurate calculations and present results.</li></ol>","learning"=>"&nbsp;Since I had already known how to do MS offices, I could learn new subjects efficiently so that I could apply the skills to assignments. <br /><br />&nbsp;Although I had little bit of knowledge of MS offices, Learning MS Words, Excel, Access and PowerPoint was quite useful. Especially MS Access helps me to understand how to manage database. Furthermore, knowing the use of PowerPoint has supported me to result in decent assignments. It still provide me to do simple design work.","difficulty"=>"&nbsp;Getting used to new applications is always not only challenging but also exiting. Keeping up with the lecturer’s instruction during classes prevented me from being disrupted. Other than following the instruction, it was effective, practical and fun class.");

<li>Use appropriate software tools to model problem scenarios.</li>
<li>Apply problem solving methodologies relevant to computing and mathematical problems.</li></ol>","learning"=>"&nbsp;I could learn how to manage and solve problems.  As an IT person, I am expected to meet a myriad problems in different situations.
<br /><br />&nbsp;It was quite related to enhance numeracy for students. Over the course I could learn the mathematical way approaching the problems.
<br /><br />&nbsp;Learning number systems, such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal lead me to understand how the computer actually communicates.
","difficulty"=>"&nbsp;Changing a number between different number systems was brain taking work. Before understood how they work, it was challenging to add and subtract two numbers in unfamiliar number systems.
As hexadecimal number and others are widely used in IT industry, it was worth having some time to understand them.");

<li>The student will be able to explore the relationship between culture and communication so that cross-cultural communication can be improved.</li>
<li>The student will be ale to demonstrate the identification of different audiences and use of appropriate technologies for information transfer.</li></ol>",
"learning"=>"&nbsp;Encountering the word profession always makes me a bit nervous even though I will be a professional person in IT industry one day!!! <br /><br />&nbsp;It was great opportunity to learn professional writing and communication skills. Furthermore during the assignment I could learn the importance of understanding cultural considerations. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have confidence in professional manner from the course.",
"difficulty"=>"&nbsp;Although I was struggling writing email and essay in professional way during assignments, with lecturer’s assistant I could get excellent grade from the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;It was the first time to apply APA reference in essay so referencing from all resources was complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;Having business in multi-cultural country such as New Zealand or in overseas may depends on understanding the diverse culture backgrounds. Learning totally new culture to me may be challenging but I hope it will be exiting as well."
